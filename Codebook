## Codebook

The data comes from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Experiment. The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

Gyroscope is a device for measuring or maintaining orientation, based on the principles of angular momentum & allows accurate recognition of movement within a 3D space In contrast, an accelerometer is a compact device designed to measure non-gravitational acceleration. UCI HAR Dataset Description The dataset includes the following files:-

'README.txt'
'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector
'features.txt': List of all features.
'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
'test/y_test.txt': Test labels. Variable Description For each participant, there are several things being measured along the XYZ axes,
Angular Velocity, Acceleration, Maginutude, Angle along with some derived values, e.g. Jerk is derived from Acceleration and Angular Velocity
tBodyAcc-XYZ | tGravityAcc-XYZ | tBodyAccJerk-XYZ | tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ | tBodyAccMag | tGravityAccMag | tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag | tBodyGyroJerkMag | fBodyAcc-XYZ | fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ | fBodyAccMag | fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag | fBodyGyroJerkMag |
Using, the Euclidean norm, the magnitude of the inputs listed above were calculated
The variable have a time (prefix t) and frequency (prefix f) domain component.
Variables are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]
These signals were used to estimate statistical variables [mean, std deviation, min, max ,skew, kurtosis etc.] for each of the feature vector pattern: '-XYZ' is used to denote 3 axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
A listing of the statistical variables created is described under the file "FeatureInfo"
A complete list of the 561 variables is available in the file "Features.txt" As stated in the assumptions above, as part of the project, only mean() & stddev() estimates are included in the analysis.
